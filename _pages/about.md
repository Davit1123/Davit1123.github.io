In 2022, I defended my thesis while working at EURECOM on the European Training Network WindMill (ETN) project, where I served as a doctoral student under the supervision of [Maurizio Filippone](https://www.eurecom.fr/~filippon/). During my PhD I was visiting student at the  Machine Leaning Genoa Center (hosted by [Lorenzo Rosasco](https://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/)) and  at the Center for Research in Economics and Statistics - working with [Alexandre Tsybakov](https://crest.science/user/alexandre-tsybakov/). 

My primary research interest covers kernels methods, scalability of algorithms, transfer learning and optimization.
